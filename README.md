## üí° Project Idea
SmartRoute is an AI-powered software solution designed to optimize public transportation by preventing bus bunking‚Äîa situation where multiple buses reach the same stop simultaneously, leading to inefficiencies. Using real-time GPS tracking, machine learning-based clustering detection (Gemini AI), and dynamic stop alternation, the system ensures better bus distribution, reduces overcrowding, and enhances passenger experience. It also provides real-time visualization for transport authorities to monitor bus flow and improve transit efficiency without requiring additional hardware.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- üîç Feature 1: Real-Time Bus Tracking: Continuously monitors bus locations using GPS and Google Maps API, ensuring up-to-date transit data.
- ‚ö° Feature 2: AI-Powered Clustering Detection: Uses machine learning (Gemini AI, K-Means, DBSCAN) to detect bus congestion and prevent bus bunking.
- üõ°Ô∏è Feature 3:  Dynamic Stop Optimization: Suggests alternate stops in real-time to distribute passenger load and reduce overcrowding. Live Data Visualization & Monitoring: Uses Leaflet.js for an interactive dashboard displaying congestion hotspots and bus routes.
